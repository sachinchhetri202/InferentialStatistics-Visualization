"# InferentialStatistics-Visualization" 

This project consists of:

Cleaning and Filtering
There is a URL column. That is data about the people. You can use it to look into more detail about the people if you would like. However, for the analysis, drop the column.
Filter out all people that do not have a 'LOST' or 'SURVIVED' entry in the 'Survived?' column. There are various reasons why people did not have those entries. For example, they might have been crew, but were not on board the Titanic at the time it capsized.

Tasks
Chi-Squared tests:
Perform a Chi-Squared test on the 'Gender' column using 'Survived' as the dependent variable. What did you find? What does it mean?
Perform a similar Chi-Squared on 'Class/Dept' (which department the crew worked in) using 'Survived' as the dependent variable. What did you find? What does it mean?
Perform a similar Chi-Squared on 'Joined' using 'Survived' as the dependent variable. What did you find? What does it mean?
 
ANOVA:
Perform an ANOVA on 'Class/Dept' as it is given in the data set using 'Age' as the dependent variable.
If there is statistical significance, do a Tukey HSD comparison and report which departments are statistically significant from each other.
Regardless, report on what you found and what it means.
 

Separate 'Gender' Column:
Many people think that the best predictor is the crew's gender or sex.

Do the following (use both Pearson's and Spearman's correlations):

What is the correlation of 'female' to survived?
What is the correlation of 'male' to survived? (It is okay if it opposite of the female.)
 
Bivariate Visualizations:
Do the following at least 3 times (AT LEAST 3 visualizations):

Create a bivariate visualization (e.g. scatter plot) between the 'Survived' column and another.

You may separate columns - like you did with the Gender column - and visualize subsets of the data if you think that will increase your understanding. For example, you can do a scatter plot of 'Survived' and female.

Multivariate Visualization:
Now we need to see the actual interaction between multiple variables.

Use AT LEAST one multivariate visualization (like Parallel Coordinates, heat map, or pair plot of multiple columns).
